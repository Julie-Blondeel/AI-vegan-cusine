        The Coconut Rice Bowl. You can adapt it to seasonal veggies and use whatever protein you prefer!
        Here we are using tofu as our protein along with asparagus and peas in honor of Springtime. The rice is rich and
        delicious, cooked in coconut milk with a little curry powder giving it gorgeous color and warm flavor undertones without
        being overpowering. While the rice cooks, the tofu and veggies are prepped, seared, and saut√©ed.
